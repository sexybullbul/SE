Problem Statement:

Development of a Relevance-Based Movie Recommendation System

Objective:

 Design and implement a movie recommendation system that ranks and suggests movies based
 on the relevance of a user's preferences, such as genre, actors, or ratings. The system should
 help users discover new movies that match their tastes and interests.


Problem Description:

 With the vast number of movies available on streaming platforms, users often face the
 challenge of finding movies that are relevant to their preferences. A movie recommendation
 system helps to solve this problem by suggesting movies that the user is likely to enjoy based
 on their past interactions, preferences, and behavior.
 The system should meet the following requirements:

1. User Profile:- The system should allow users to create a profile that includes their movie preferences, such
 as preferred genres (e.g., action, comedy, drama), favorite actors, and preferred movie ratings
 (e.g., only recommend movies with ratings above 7/10).

2. Movie Database:- The system should have a database of movies that includes information such as title, genre,
 cast, director, release year, and IMDb rating.

3. Query Input:- The user should be able to input their preferences or queries, such as "Show me action
 movies with Tom Hanks," or "Recommend me drama movies with ratings above 8."

4. Relevance Calculation:- Implement an algorithm to calculate the relevance of movies to the user's query. This can be
 done using methods like weighted scoring based on genre, actor, and ratings, or more
 advanced methods like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

5. Ranking Results:- The system should rank the recommended movies in order of relevance based on the user's
 input, with the most relevant movie at the top of the list.

6. Display Results:- Display a list of recommended movies with essential details such as the movie title, genre,
 lead actors, and IMDb rating. Each movie entry should also include a brief synopsis to help the
 user decide whether they would like to watch it.

7. Evaluation:- The system should include an evaluation mechanism to assess the quality of the
 recommendations, such as user ratings or feedback on the suggested movies.
 

Deliverables:- A fully functional movie recommendation system.- A user-friendly interface that allows users to input preferences and receive recommendations.- Documentation explaining the design, algorithms used for relevance calculation, and the
 overall functioning of the system.- A report analyzing the effectiveness of your recommendation system and possible
 improvements.


Tools and Technologies:- Programming Language: Python, Java, or C#- Data Structure: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries, or HashMaps- Database: SQLite, MySQL, or a simple file-based database (CSV, JSON)- Libraries (optional): Pandas, NumPy (for data handling), Scikit-learn (for machine learning
 algorithms), or TensorFlow/Keras (for advanced models)
Expected Outcomes:- Gain practical experience in building recommendation systems and applying machine learning
 techniques to real-world problems.- Understand how to build and query databases efficiently to store and retrieve movie
 information.- Develop skills in ranking and filtering algorithms to enhance user experience and deliver
 personalized recommendations.
